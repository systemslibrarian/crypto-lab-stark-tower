/**
 * Known WCAG 1.4.11 / generated-content findings in this lab, captured through
 * the gate's own path so the baseline and the check cannot disagree.
 *
 * THIS FILE IS A TO-DO LIST, NOT A SET OF EXEMPTIONS. The gate ratchets on it:
 *   - a finding NOT listed here fails the run, so a regression cannot land;
 *   - a listed finding whose ratio gets WORSE fails, so the list cannot rot;
 *   - a listed finding that no longer appears ALSO fails, so a fixed entry must
 *     be deleted and the file can only shrink toward empty.
 * The last rule is what stops an allowlist becoming a permanent exemption.
 *
 * `unverified: true` marks an absolutely-positioned pseudo-element. It can
 * paint outside its host and the oracle measures it against the host's
 * backdrop, so that ratio is NOT trustworthy — hand-measure before acting on
 * it.

  // Everything the live oracle finds over {dark, light} × {1280, 380} and every
  // state the drive builds is exactly these two, and both are in the SHARED
  // Crypto Lab top bar rather than in anything this repo owns.
  //
  // `.cl-btn` draws its edge as
  // `1px solid color-mix(in srgb, var(--accent, #35d6bb) 38%, transparent)`
  // over the bar's fixed `#0b1512`. This lab names its accent `--acc`, not
  // `--accent`, so the fallback teal applies and the composited edge resolves to
  // rgb(27, 94, 82): 2.45:1 against the bar, IDENTICALLY IN BOTH THEMES,
  // because the bar is always dark and the theme does not move it.
  //
  // Not fixed here on purpose. Every repo in this fleet carries a byte-identical
  // copy of that markup and CSS, and `CLAUDE.md` is explicit that a change every
  // lab should get is a deliberate reviewed fleet-wide pass and never an
  // overwrite driven from one repo. Defining `--accent` locally to satisfy the
  // bar would silently repaint the bar's brand ink too, since `--cl-ink` is
  // mixed from the same variable. So it is measured here, ratcheted here, and
  // reported upward.
  //
  // Everything inside `<main id="app">`, the hero and the footer is audited with
  // no exemption, and comes back clean — including `.disclosure summary::before`,
  // the `▸`/`▾` marker that is the sole affordance on this page's one
  // `<details>`, since the same rule removes the UA triangle.
